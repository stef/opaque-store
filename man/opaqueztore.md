# NAME

opaqueztore - OPAQUE-Store server

# SYNOPSIS

`opaqueztore`

# DESCRIPTION

OPAQUE-Store is a simple protocol that allows anyone to store encrypted blobs
of information online, with only a password needed to retrieve the information.
As the name implies it uses the OPAQUE protocol to do so. OPAQUE-Store uses the
`export_key` feature of OPAQUE to encrypt the data that is stored on the
OPAQUE-Storage server.

The server runs in the foreground and emits log messages to standard output. If
you want to run it as a daemon, you should deploy it using service supervision
tools such as s6, runit or daemontools.

When configured, the server should publish its long-term signing public-key so
that clients can use it in a threshold setup.

# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

You **should** back up your SSL key, `record_salt` configuration value,
ltsigkey and of course all blobs regularly.
